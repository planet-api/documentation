The planet generator API is based on a suite of noise generation algorithms. The process is totally random and won't produce two time the same planet. Better save the ones you like ðŸ˜‰.

**The API produces a 1080x1080 unmasked sprite**: Basic sprite with no effect. It requires further processing from your side (apply your own masks, shadows, light effects, ...). Alternatively, you can post-process it via one of our SDK.

They are more than 10 different kind of planets (Ice, Gaz, Sand, Plasma, Barren, Lava, Moon, ...), but due to the random nature of the system, it is not currently possible to choose a specific one.
